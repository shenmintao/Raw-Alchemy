## 📖 Core Philosophy

Many photographers and videographers rely on creative LUTs (Look Up Tables) to achieve specific visual styles. However, a common pain point is: **When applying LUTs that perform perfectly in video workflows to RAW photos, colors often go wrong.**

This issue stems from color space mismatches. Most creative LUTs are designed for specific Log color spaces (e.g., Sony S-Log3/S-Gamut3.Cine or Fujifilm F-Log2/F-Gamut). When you open a RAW photo in Photoshop or Lightroom and directly apply these LUTs, the software's default RAW decoding color space does not match the LUT's expected input space, leading to severe color and tonal deviations.

**Raw Alchemy Studio** was born to solve this problem. It builds a rigorous, automated color pipeline to ensure any LUT can be accurately applied to any RAW file:

1.  **Standardized Decoding**: The project first decodes RAW files from any source into a standardized, wide-gamut intermediate space — ProPhoto RGB (Linear). This eliminates color science differences inherent in different camera brands, providing a unified starting point for all operations.
2.  **Precise Log Signal Preparation**: Next, it precisely converts the linear image data into the Log format expected by the target LUT, such as `F-Log2` curve and `F-Gamut` color space. This step is critical for ensuring color consistency, perfectly simulating the process of generating Log video signals inside a camera.
3.  **Correct LUT Application**: Applying your creative LUT on this accurately "disguised" Log image results in color and tonal performance identical to that in professional video software (like DaVinci Resolve).
4.  **High-Bit Depth Output**: Finally, the processed image (keeping Log encoding or with LUT effects applied) is saved as a 16-bit TIFF, HEIF, or JPEG file, maximizing dynamic range and color information retention for professional grading.

Through this process, `Raw Alchemy Studio` breaks down the barrier between RAW photography and professional video color grading, allowing photographers to enjoy cinema-level color management precision.

## 🔄 Process Flow

This tool follows these precise color conversion steps:

`RAW (Camera Native)` -> `ProPhoto RGB (Linear)` -> `Lens Correction` -> `Exposure & WB` -> `Target Log Gamut (Linear)` -> `Target Log Curve (e.g. F-Log2)` -> `(Optional) Creative LUT` -> `Output (TIFF/HEIF/JPG)`

## ✨ Features

-   **RAW to Linear**: Decodes RAW files directly into ProPhoto RGB (Linear) working color space.
-   **Log Conversion**: Supports various camera-specific Log formats (F-Log2, S-Log3, LogC4, etc.).
-   **LUT Application**: Supports applying `.cube` creative LUT files directly during conversion.
-   **Advanced Exposure Control**:
    -   **Auto Metering**: Matrix, Hybrid, Average, Center-Weighted, Highlight-Safe (ETTR).
    -   **Manual Override**: Precise EV adjustment.
-   **Basic Adjustments**: White Balance (Temp/Tint), Saturation, Contrast, Highlights, and Shadows.
-   **Lens Correction**: Automatic lens distortion correction using Lensfun, with support for custom LCP-converted databases.
-   **Batch Processing**: Efficiently process entire folders of RAW images.
-   **Multi-Format Output**: Save as 16-bit TIFF, HEIF (10-bit), HDR HEIF (BT.2020/PQ), or JPEG.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Recommended)

For most users, the easiest way to use Raw Alchemy Studio is to download the pre-compiled executable. This does not require installing Python or any dependencies.

1.  Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/shenmintao/raw-alchemy/releases) page.
2.  Download the latest executable for your system (e.g., `RawAlchemy-vX.Y.Z-windows.exe` or `RawAlchemy-vX.Y.Z-linux`).
3.  Run the tool. See the [Usage](#usage) section for details.

## 💻 Installation from Source (For Developers)

If you want to install the project from source, you can follow these steps:

**macOS** — install system libraries first:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shenmintao/raw-alchemy.git
cd raw-alchemy

# Install macOS system dependencies (required by pyexiv2)
brew bundle

# Install the tool and its dependencies
pip install .
```

**Linux / Windows:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shenmintao/raw-alchemy.git
cd raw-alchemy
pip install .
```

*Note: This project depends on specific versions of `rawpy` and `colour-science`.*

**macOS CoreML cache:** Compiled models are cached under
`~/Library/Caches/RawAlchemy/coreml/`. Cache namespaces are derived from the ONNX
model and all referenced external weight file contents, ONNX Runtime and system
versions, architecture, and session variants (including demosaic tile size).
Replacing model/weight contents at the same path creates a new namespace on the
next session initialization. Model and external weight contents are rehashed at
session initialization; there is no path, file-size, or timestamp shortcut.
If cache preparation, hashing, or the writability check fails, a warning is
logged and CoreML continues without caching. Old namespaces are not automatically
removed; you can delete this cache directory while the app is closed to reclaim
space (the next launch recompiles the models).

**Demosaic acceleration fallback:** If accelerated RCD or X-Trans session
initialization (including CoreML compilation) or inference fails, a warning is
logged and CPU execution is attempted. After a successful initialization fallback,
that demosaicer stays on CPU for the rest of the process, even across tile-size
changes. Processing may be slower. CPU errors are still reported, not retried
indefinitely. Restart the app to retry acceleration.

## 🛠️ Usage

The executable provides both a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a Command-Line Interface (CLI).

*   **To launch the GUI**: Simply run the executable without any arguments.
*   **To use the CLI**: Run the executable with command-line arguments.

## 🖥️ GUI Tutorial

The graphical interface provides an intuitive way to process your images.

## 🔧 Advanced Usage: Importing Adobe Lens Profiles (LCP)

Raw Alchemy Studio includes a script to convert and import Adobe LCP lens profiles.

The conversion script, `lensfun-convert-lcp`, can be found in the `src/raw_alchemy/vendor/lensfun` directory after installation or in the source.

**Steps:**

1.  **Locate your LCP files** (typically in Adobe's ProgramData or Library folders).
2.  **Run the conversion script**:
    ```bash
    python src/raw_alchemy/vendor/lensfun/win-x86_64/lensfun-convert-lcp "path/to/lcp/folder" --output "my_lenses.xml"
    ```
3.  **Load the XML**: In the GUI, use the "Custom Lensfun Database" browse button to load your generated XML file.

## ⌨️ CLI Usage

**Note**: On Linux, you may need to make the file executable first (e.g., `chmod +x ./RawAlchemy-v0.1.0-linux`).

#### CLI Basic Syntax

```bash
# Using the executable
RawAlchemy-v0.1.0-windows.exe [OPTIONS] <INPUT_RAW_PATH> <OUTPUT_PATH>
```

The CLI uses neutral saturation and contrast defaults (`1.0` / `1.0`). GUI defaults are unchanged.

#### Examples

**1. Basic Log Conversion**
```bash
./RawAlchemy-linux "image.CR3" "output.tiff" --log-space "F-Log2"
```

**2. With Creative LUT and HEIF Output**
```bash
./RawAlchemy-linux "input.ARW" "output.heif" --log-space "S-Log3" --lut "looks/my_look.cube" --format heif
```

**3. Batch Processing**
```bash
./RawAlchemy-linux "C:/Photos/2024" "C:/Photos/Processed" --log-space "LogC4" --jobs 8
```

## ⚙️ Command Line Options

-   `<INPUT_RAW_PATH>`: (Required) Input RAW file or folder.
-   `<OUTPUT_PATH>`: (Required) Output file or folder.
-   `--log-space TEXT`: (Optional) Target Log color space; defaults to `None` for scene-referred output.
-   `--lut TEXT`: (Optional) Path to a `.cube` LUT file.
-   `--exposure FLOAT`: (Optional) Manual exposure adjustment in stops.
-   `--metering TEXT`: (Optional) Auto exposure mode: `matrix`, `hybrid`, `average`, `center-weighted`, `highlight-safe`.
-   `--format TEXT`: (Optional) Output format: `tif` (default), `heif`, `hdr-heif`, `jpg`, `dng`.

`hdr-heif` writes a 10-bit BT.2020/PQ HEIF file and uses the PQ output path directly; Log/LUT output is ignored for that format. Ultra HDR / ISO 21496-1 gain-map JPEG is not implemented yet; ordinary `jpg` output remains SDR.
-   `--jobs INTEGER`: (Optional) Number of concurrent jobs for batch processing.
-   `--lens-correct BOOLEAN`: (Optional) Enable/disable lens correction; accepts legacy values such as `false`.
-   `--no-lens-correct`: (Optional) Disable lens correction.
